Before We Start
===============

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/langmore/boot-camps.git -b python-all-day2  python-all-day2


Introducing Programming Through Python
======================================

Goals:

By the end of these scientific Python lessons, you will be able to:

1. Describe and distinguish the seven core elements shared by all programming
   languages.
2. Use Python to write simple programs that use these core elements, using
   both the core library and scientific packages such as numpy.
3. Make and save simple publication-quality plots using matplotlib.
4. Read, manipulate, and save data files in csv and text formats.
5. Write unit tests to confirm the accuracy of your Python code.

The Seven Core Concepts
-----------------------

As noted by Greg Wilson (the founder of Software Carpentry), every programming
language shares [seven core elements][1]:

1.       Individual things (the number 2, the string 'hello', a matplotlib figure)
2.       Commands that operate on things (the + symbol, the `len` function)
3.       Groups of things (Python lists, tuples, and dictionaries)
4.       Ways to repeat yourself (for and while loops)
5.       Ways to make choices (if and try statements)
6.       Ways to create chunks (functions, objects/classes, and modules)
7.       Ways to combine chunks (function composition)


Running IPython Notebook
========================

    cd boot-camps
    cd 1-Python
    ipython notebook --pylab inline

Open the `python-nb-demo` notebook.


Work Through Three Notebooks
============================

    cd python-all-day2/2-Python/

1. python-nb-demo
2. functions-in-python
3. grannies
